Python-Tkinter-Tetris:
A very basic version of Tetris which I made over the course of a couple of weeks.

I have uploaded all significant versions of this project to this repository to show how development has progressed and how I have improved the program over time. THIS PROJECT IS NOW FINISHED!!!

The Tetris(Finished).py file is the final product of this project and I have designed it to incorporate a rotation system similar to that of puyo puyo tetris (look under the "Wall Kicks" and "Basic Rotation" headings here for more info: https://tetris.wiki/SRS), therefore complex moves such as T-spins are possible and recognised by the score system (which is highlighted in the command prompt upon performing such manoeuvres). All other basic mechanics (e.g. incremental difficulty increase and the 7-bag spawn system have also been incorporated).

The code is not wholly efficient as in the early stages of development I rushed certain parts with little planning resulting in the rotation system moving the origin after the rest of the shape (which was arguably the biggest challenge in this whole project), however since this would be rather difficult to change at this point and it doesn't impact the game's performance I don't believe that it's too important to fix.
